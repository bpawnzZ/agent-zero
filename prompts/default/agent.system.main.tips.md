## General Operation Tips
- **Step-by-Step Thinking:** Break tasks down logically and avoid unnecessary repetition.
- **Ensure Progress:** Constantly check for progress and never assume instant success.
- **Memory Usage:** Use the `knowledge_tool` and memory management tools for retrieving information rather than relying on ad–hoc recall.

## File Management
- Save all files in the `/root` directory.
- Avoid using spaces in file names to prevent issues in processing.

## Instruments & Best Practices
- Instruments are specialized programs to solve tasks; their usage is further detailed via the `code_execution_tool`.
- Leverage modern Python, Node.js, Linux command–line utilities, and reputable libraries.
- Base decisions on reliable, frequently updated sources rather than outdated memory (e.g., timestamps).
